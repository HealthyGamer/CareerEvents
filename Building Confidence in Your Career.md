## Dunning-Kruger

Let's go ahead and get the graph out of the way. If you are unaware of the Dunning-Kruger effect, it was initially studied in 1999 and has been confirmed in later research. If you only know a little bit about a given topic, you will vastly overestimate your abilities. This is commonly called "mount stupid" or "all of social media."

Having any real expertise in an area makes the reality of this bias undeniable and frustrating. We've all met at least one person who is incredibly confident that they are right while still wholly wrong. In the best case, it's a joke that they don't realize they are telling. At worst, this can have serious negative consequences.

## Why This is Important

### Understanding Our Own Biases

One of the values of understanding that these biases exist is to inform our understanding of ourselves. One of the main reasons it is a serious issue when dealing with professionals on "mount stupid" is they often don't realize that's where they are. I'm not sure it is possible to avoid that scenario altogether (more on that in a bit), but we can attempt to avoid staying there too long.

Outside of avoiding annoying our colleagues and making fundamental mistakes in our work, the whole other three-quarters of this graph is also useful when understanding what a path to understanding would look like. There is a common explanation for the rest of this graph. Past the peak of "mount stupid," is that past that point, you start to understand just how much you don't know as well as what you do.

This creates a massive drop in confidence at the beginning as you realize the sheer amount of knowledge you are lacking, and it can be paralyzing to sit in that space. Fortunately, as you gain knowledge while still being mindful of the full information available, you'll better be able to gauge your own abilities.

### Why This Idea Can Be Wrong

When looking at this graph, the main thing to understand is that it shows an overall trend, not your specific path. Individuals have ups and downs, not smooth lines. Just because you've gained enough knowledge to be aware of how much you have to learn does not prevent you from being overconfident. It also does not stop you from thinking you are worse at your job than you are.

People can think they are on the right side of the graph while at the peak because they believe their knowledge of something applies more broadly than it does. I've learned about teaching tech topics in a space like Discord but using that same confidence level on Youtube, Twitch, or a physical classroom would be a mistake. While some of the skills are transferable, it would be a mistake to consider myself an expert on those platforms.

## Creating Confidence Without Being Overconfident

### Growth Mindset

Learning is the enemy of "mount stupid." The bias exists because of a lack of knowledge, so one of the best ways to overcome it is to continue learning. This is the natural outcome when you adopt a growth mindset. A growth mindset is generally defined as the idea that your current skill level isn't permanent. Working at the problem and learning will allow you to build your skills.

This is especially valuable when your Confidence dips. Instead of despairing that you will never be good enough, it creates a space where you can be more skilled. You don't have to stay incompetent forever. Right after "mount stupid" is the "valley of despair." This is a place where it is easy to give up on the topic instead of pushing forward. However, a growth mindset can give you the hope that you need to push through.

Note: Learning how to learn is a topic that deserves its own discussion, so I won't get into it here. However, as we discuss learning and growth mindset, this becomes a massively valuable skill worth spending time on.

### Getting Useful Feedback

While it is possible to reflect on your own skills and understand where you are, it is challenging to do it accurately. Getting an outside perspective can do a lot to calibrate your own personal estimation. Another way to put it is that external information can help you be more confident about your current confidence level.

The important thing is useful feedback. Not all feedback is useful. Arguably, most of it. I prefer to view all feedback as having some little bit of truth, but that doesn't mean I need to act on it. .05% truth does not make helpful feedback, but that mindset helps me personally to be more gracious when getting information I disagree with.

There are a few key points in getting this information:
The best feedback in my experience comes from people affected by your work. Customers, clients, teammates, etc. This is especially true of people you respect as experts- they are in the best position to judge your skills. These are the people who care most about you and the quality of your work.
Learn to accept negative criticism. Well thought negative criticism is scary because many people do not take it well. If the people closest to you feel safe talking openly about their thoughts, they are more likely to do so. Doesn't automatically make it worthwhile, just more honest.
Ask for feedback directly. This is hard, especially when your confidence is low, but you can get helpful information at any spot on the curve. You may even learn that you are actually undervaluing your skills.
Once you get the info, you have to learn to apply it. Even with good information, you don't have to act on it immediately. You may never use it in your work. There are times when I knew I screwed up so badly I didn't bother reading event feedback- I had plenty of stuff to work on already. If you've established a foundation of learning and growth, feedback becomes much easier to use. It can help guide what to focus on.

### Understand Confidence in a Skill Versus Your Whole Job

A common reason people lack confidence in their skills, in my opinion, is that it can be easy to equate skill with a specific task. Most jobs will involve at least some tasks that you are clueless about, and you still need to be able to do your job.

For example, when dealing with upper management (at least in the US), there is an expectation that you will always speak with confidence. It's a part of building trust that you will be able to accomplish what they ask. "I don't know, but I can find out and get back to you" becomes a magic phrase that allows you to speak confidently without actually knowing the answer. It gives you time to leverage skills like asking for help and knowing how to learn new things to gain the needed knowledge to complete the task.

Another example might be starting a new job. Regardless of how much experience you have, there will be elements of the job that are new to you. It does not mean that your existing skills magically disappeared, it just means you need time to integrate those skills with new ones needed for this job.
