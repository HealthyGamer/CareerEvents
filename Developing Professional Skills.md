# Developing Your Professional Skillset

In many professions we champion the concept of the "lifelong learner," but what does that actually look like in real life?

## Have a Learning Plan

Your learning plan may be little more than a "maybe someday I'll get around to it" list in the back of your mind, but this isn't ideal. "Someday" rarely comes, so having a bit more structure around timelines makes it more likely you will make progress. Some detail is also a good thing- which books do you want to read? Which courses do you want to take? Which blogs do you want to follow?

### Hard Skill vs. Soft Skills

It's pretty common to see learning plans in tech that include things like learning a new language or framework or diving deep into algorythim design, but rare to see plans that include our ability to communicate those same ideas to others. The focus on what is known as "hard skills" instead of "soft skills" i.e. the squishy human side of working in the modern world.

Part of the overemphasis on hard skills in tech, and many other professions, may come from a self perpetuating cycle- people who have been in the profession for a long time never focused on these skills, so when giving advice they don't include them. The problem is, we are automating away more and more of the work that requires hard skills. That leaves these soft skills as a gap where automation can't yet take over.

The other part of the issue is that soft skills can be more difficult to learn. You can still read books and blogs to pick up some ideas, but in the end you need other humans to try these things on, and then ask for feedback and reflect on how things went. While things like going to a lecture might be considerably more effort than just reading about the topic, the effort may be worthwhile if you also get to spend some time with other people in your field discussing what you've learned and networking with them.

### Explore Adjacent (and Even Opposite) Skills

If you look around at what is considered an "ideal" skillset you'll start to see discussions about a t-shaped skillset. This is someone who has a deep knowledge of one or two areas, but also has a breadth of knowledge from other areas. Music is a great example of this. Usually a given musician will specialize in a specific style of music. However, when they start to borrow elements from other styles, they can start to create music that is new and unique. Similarly, a professional who has invested in learning a variety of different things means that you will have a unique set of viewpoints and experiences to bring to your job that is atractive to many employers. You may even discover that something you are learning about is something you want to pursue as a possible focus point in your career moving forward.

## Make It a Priority

### Learning Is a Valuable Long Term Investment

When you are facing an issue and have to investigate the solution, you may see that as a short term investment. And that's true, but that info is also available to you in the future and the accumulation of these solutions is a part of what can make an experienced professional so valuable. As the saying goes "junior devs just copy/paste code. Senior devs know which code to copy/paste". The value in a lot of scenarios isn't being able to solve the problem yourself, it's being able to see which possible solution is best for your situation and applying it.

This is also why learning outside of an immediate problem is valuable. It lets you focus on understanding context around an item, instead of just the specific problem itself. Learning while working is often a bit like reading random pages from a textbook- you'll get a decent idea of what to do, but you'll have pieces that are missing until you read the rest of the book.

### Make Learning a Habit

Many employers, at least in the tech industry, are growing to understand the value of dedicated learning time and ensuring devs get it as part of their normal workday. Even if you aren't so fortunate, building learning into your daily life will help ensure you keep at it. This doesn't have to always be a big chunk of your time. Reading a blog post or two instead of scrolling TikTok can be a good way to squeeze this in, though there's no need to get rid of all your TikTok time ;).

### Create Space For It

When we talked about remote working, we talked about setting aside some space at home specifically for working, even if the difference was just changing the color for your lights or lighting a specific type of candle. Learning works best the same way. You may not set aside a specific space in your home for it, but you can choose specific music, lights, scents, and surroundings to set yourself up that this is learning time.

## Learn Together With Others

### Leverage Community to Help You Meet Your Goals

Events like 'Study Together' here on Discord are a great tool you can use to motivate your learning. Peer pressure doesn't have to be a bad thing when it helps you do beneficial things. Community also helps you to find new resources and get you unstuck when you need it. Fortunately for those in tech, this sort of thing is built in to the industry, you just need to take advantage of it.

### Practice Your New Skills With Other People

Most of the topics I teach on Discord are because people in the community find them interesting or important, though sometimes I just pick something that I personally think is useful. When I'm picking, it's usually because it's something that I think is important *and* I want to learn more about. By teaching the info I push myself to learn the material better than I would otherwise. Teaching directly isn't the only way to do this, but it is a good one. Blogs, LinkedIn posts, Youtube, and similar content types can fill in this role extremely well and can serve the dual purpose of improving your professional reputation.
