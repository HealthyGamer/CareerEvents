## Be Honest With Why You Are Doing the Project

There is a lot of pressure in the tech industry to have side project and to produce a "finished" project every time. Neither of these is ultimately true and pursuing projects for these reasons can cause you to struggle to stay motivated to complete projects. Often this results in "project graveyards" that we feel guilty about.

Digging into why you are doing a given project can be difficult but can also change you you look at your side projects. Specifically we often use side projects to try out an idea or learn a skill. When you have achieved that goal the project is essentially "done" by that metric. You may continue for another reason, but unless you have a new goal in mind *you don't need to continue just to meet someone else's definition of success.*

## Be Honest With the Time Commitment and Requirements

Some projects can be flexible with how much time you spend others are not. Some require you to spend time every week, others can be put on pause. Some don't have a specific schedule, but do have deadlines.

When considering a project take a look at these types of things. The average coding project is as flexible as possible- no schedule, no deadline, nothing. However, this isn't always the case and the situation can change.

Lets take the example of an open source package. You can build one on your personal GitHub account and you are free to do what you want, including abandoning the project with no concequences. However, if you include other people on your project it can give you valuable experience, but it also means you are making commitments to your teammates about how/what/when you are going to contribute to the project. Similarly, if you upload your project to the relevant package manager then you may need to continue updating the package for others, or make arrangements to hand off or discontinue the project.

## Build In Structure

Now that you've figured out what the time commitment will look like, it is time to figure out if it can fit into your schedule. In order to do that, you have to have a schedule. As boundaries between work and personal life get blurred it can be difficult to keep your work life fully seperated from your project time.

Even if you don't have solid boundaries around your work hours (I certainly don't) you can still create some form of structure around work vs. project time. You might not be able to convince your boss that you shouldn't answer emails after hours, you might be able to justify not answering immediately. You could set aside an hour for project work, and only check email before and after that time. If they email right before, you might send an acknowledgement but not start work until after your project block.

Regardless of your work schedule, there was a key point in that last example- it's that your side project also had specific time set aside for it. You might be able to have a project that you only work on when you have extra time, but that more than likely means you will never get to it.

## Build In Flexibility

The flip side to structure is flexibility, and side projects work best when you have both. Your side projects are going to have a certain amount of priority in your life, and it will likely be pretty low on your list. So while you want to have a schedule for when you are working on your project, it's also helpful to be flexible with that schedule.

Both moving and completely skipping a scheduled work time are tools that you have to keep your project from becoming and issue. If you find yourself adjusting your schedule a lot, then you may wish to reevaluate your schedule or whether or not you have the bandwidth to be doing that particular project right now.

## Get Off Your Tech Regularly

Perhaps more important than the time you spend working on the project is the time you spend not working on a project at all. This means scheduling not only time for your projects but also time for yourself, friends, and family. It might be tempting to do things like work on your projects on the weekends because you are so tired from work you don't want to do them after work, but that can simply make the problem worse as you are not days off on your days off.

This is also a personal take, but I'm becoming more and more convinced that as devs, we should have at least one non-tech hobby that we engage in regularly. There is something extremely draining about moving from screen to screen to screen constantly, and stepping away from that even for a few hours can be extremely refreshing. Having an activity you enjoy during that period  will help encourage you to take the time. Since I currently have only one day off a week, I also make that my low-tech day. Spending it listening to podcasts and music while doing things like doing chores that have been neglected and projects like knitting or crochet.
